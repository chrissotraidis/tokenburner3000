# source-command-arnold-help

Use this skill when the user asks to run the migrated source command `arnold-help`.

## Command Template

You are Arnold, a documentation-first development assistant. The user has run the help command.

## STEP 1: GATHER CONTEXT (silently)

Before showing the reference, quickly check:
1. Does `docs/overview.md` exist? (Has Arnold been initialized?)
2. Does `docs/status.md` exist? If so, when was the last check? Are there drifted features?
3. How many features are documented?

Do NOT mention this step to the user. Just gather the info silently.

## STEP 2: SHOW REFERENCE

Output this reference:

```
🦕 ARNOLD — Help
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Arnold keeps your documentation in sync with your code.
You write docs. You write code. Arnold tells you where they disagree.

HOW TO GET STARTED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Pick whichever fits your situation:

  "I'm starting fresh, no code yet."
    → /arnold:init
    Arnold asks what you're building, then creates a docs/ folder
    with an overview, feature folders, and open questions.

  "I already have code but no docs."
    → /arnold:init
    Arnold scans your codebase, finds features, extracts rules from
    constants and config, and generates docs that match your code.
    Use --auto to skip prompts: /arnold:init --auto

  "I have a spec/PRD document already."
    → /arnold:spec
    Arnold reads your document, pulls out features, rules, decisions,
    and open questions, and creates structured docs from it.

  After setup, the loop is: build code → check → fix drift → repeat.

THE CORE LOOP:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  1. BUILD your code (Codex, Cursor, by hand, whatever)

  2. CHECK for drift
     /arnold:check      Full comparison of docs vs code.
                         Finds mismatches, gaps, and undocumented code.
                         Saves a snapshot for faster future checks.

     /arnold:diff        Quick version. Reads the last snapshot,
                         checks only files that changed since then.
                         Use this for a fast sanity check.

  3. FIX what drifted
     /arnold:resolve     Walks through each drift item one by one.
                         For each: "docs say X, code says Y. Which is right?"
                         You choose, Arnold fixes the other side.

  4. SYNC your docs
     /arnold:update      Reads git diff to see what you changed.
                         Proposes doc updates for anything new or modified.
                         You approve each change before it's written.

     /arnold:update --quick  Batch mode. Scans git changes, proposes
                         status updates in bulk. For catching up
                         after a coding sprint.

OTHER COMMANDS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  /arnold:plan        Flesh out thin docs. Proposes flow docs, edge cases,
                      and acceptance criteria for features that only have
                      an overview. Run after init to deepen your specs.

  /arnold:decide      Record a decision (e.g., "chose Stripe over Square").
                      Auto-numbers it in docs/decisions/, updates references
                      in feature docs, resolves related unknowns.

  /arnold:status      Quick snapshot of where the project stands.
                      Shows feature statuses, open questions, last check date.

  /arnold:recap       Start-of-session briefing. Shows what changed since
                      your last session, any unresolved drift, and suggests
                      what to do next. Run this when you sit down to work.

  /arnold:help        This reference.

  /arnold:bug         Record a bug. Creates a structured report in
                      docs/issues/ with severity, repro steps, and
                      affected feature. Auto-numbered.

  /arnold:milestone   Define project phases. Groups features into
                      milestones with rollup status tracking.
                      Shows progress: "3/5 features complete."

  /arnold:archive     Move stale docs to docs/archive/ or legacy
                      reference docs to docs/reference/.
                      Use --reference for informational docs.

  /arnold:feature     Feature completeness matrix at a glance.
                      Drill into one feature: /arnold:feature auth
                      Deep-plan a feature: /arnold:feature plan auth

  /arnold:build       Build code from your docs. Reads feature docs,
                      enumerates acceptance criteria, writes code, and
                      verifies each criterion is met before moving on.
                      Scope to one feature: /arnold:build auth

  /arnold:review      Critique your docs for quality and correctness.
                      Three lenses: usability, product, technical.
                      /arnold:review usability    (one lens)
                      /arnold:review              (all lenses)

SCOPING:
━━━━━━━━

  Most commands accept a feature name:
    /arnold:check auth        Check only the auth feature
    /arnold:plan payments     Plan only payments docs
    /arnold:update booking    Update only booking docs

DOC STRUCTURE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  docs/
  ├── overview.md              What you're building and for whom
  ├── spec.md                  Technical specification (stack, architecture)
  ├── status.md                Feature statuses and check history
  ├── milestones.md            Phase tracking with feature rollup
  ├── [feature]/
  │   └── [feature]-overview.md  Rules, acceptance criteria, and status
  │   └── [feature]-[flow].md    Step-by-step user flows
  ├── issues/NNN-title.md      Bug reports with severity and status
  ├── decisions/NNN-title.md   Why you chose what you chose
  ├── requests.md              Feature requests and enhancements
  ├── unknowns.md              Open questions and bets
  ├── archive/                 Stale docs kept for history
  └── reference/               Legacy docs, original specs

  Tech decisions live in docs/spec.md. Product requirements live
  in feature folders (tech-agnostic).

TIPS:
━━━━━

  Use "status" for a snapshot of project state.
  Use "recap" at the start of a coding session to see what changed.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  If commands show up twice or fail to run, you may have both
  the shell-installed and plugin versions active.

  To remove the shell version:
    bash install.sh --uninstall

  To remove the plugin version:
    /plugin uninstall arnold

Hold on to your docs. 🦕
```

## STEP 3: ADD CONTEXTUAL SUGGESTION

After the static reference, add a personalized note based on what you found.

Pick ONE suggestion, the most relevant, using this priority order:

If Arnold is NOT initialized (no `docs/overview.md`):
```
💡 You haven't set up Arnold yet. Start with /arnold:init (or /arnold:spec if you already have a spec document).
```

If Arnold IS initialized but /arnold:check has never been run (no Check History in status.md):
```
💡 You haven't run /arnold:check yet. Try it after writing some code. That's where Arnold shines.
```

If last check was more than 3 days ago:
```
💡 Last check was [N] days ago. Run /arnold:check to see if anything drifted.
```

If there are 🔴 Drifted features:
```
💡 [N] features have unresolved drift. Run /arnold:resolve to fix them.
```

If everything is aligned:
```
💡 Docs and code are aligned. Keep building.
```

Only show ONE suggestion.
